# I Am A Coder

## Description

### This project was inspired by two separate events
__Event 1__

At a conference I spoke to a gentalman who taught programming to different age groups. He approach me and other women during lunch about an issue he was having. Boys and Girls in 1st - 5th grade enjoyed coding and participated equally. However, during middle school he noticed the 30/70 split that you see in the work force today. Girls just didn't choose coding as an elective and he couldn't figure out why. He asked his highschool ladies to try and help, by volunteering, but even so the split persists. 

__Event 2__

While trying to transition into IT, I thought back on my life and realized I wasn't truly encouraged to go into IT. As I networked, conversation after conversation had the same theme. 
> "I wasn't encouraged."

> "My friends weren't into it and reputation mattered."

> "I was pushed towards the arts."

> "I had no role models who chose this path, including people on tv."

ectera, ectera, ectera. 

 __This project is an attempt to solve Event 1 and 2.__

It is here that teachers should be able to find resources to share with their class.

It is here that parents should be able to find encouragement for their daughters to choose this path.

It is here that young girls and women should be able to network and find a place where they can grow their coding skills.
